jsbastard
=========

jsbastard is intended to run in complement to jslint. It further enforces a common writing style, while still encouraging creative coding by using good habits.

Of course, jsbastard can lint itself without generating any error or warning. So have a look at the jsbastard.js file if you want to have a feel of what it enforces.
